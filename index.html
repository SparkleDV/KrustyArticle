    <h2>More people around the world than ever before are studying and learning English because it has become the international language of education and business. Our mission at Educational Testing Service (ETS) is to promote learning and support education and professional development for people worldwide. We work hard to help learners pursue their dreams of higher education or getting a good job in English-speaking environments worldwide.

        The popularity of English can be seen in the growing number of people taking the TOEFL® and TOEIC® tests, the most widely used and accepted English exams in the world. ETS creates these tests and for this reason, perhaps readers might be interested in our perception on the importance of learning English and why it should be fun.</h2>

        <h2>Working at ETS, and working with our English language testing programs, people often ask me, “What is the best way to learn English and why does it have to be so hard?” I tell them that learning any second language is hard, but that doesn’t mean it can’t be fun at the same time. The key to mastering a new language is providing opportunities at an early age while also emphasizing the development of one’s native language.

            More and more countries are introducing English-language instruction earlier in school. Japanese students begin learning English in the fifth grade and receive more intensive instruction in junior high and high school. MEXT’s call to introduce English-language instruction in third grade is a positive step in that direction.</h2>
